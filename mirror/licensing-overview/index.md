# Overview

Marketplace Partners can choose between two billing models to license their apps.

They can either adopt a user-based billing model that allows customers to pay for a Marketplace app
for only a specific subset of users within an Atlassian app instance. Alternatively, they can adopt
a billing model where customers purchase an Marketplace app for all users associated with the parent Atlassian app
instance.

Marketplace Partners have the option to use the billing model that covers all users,
or switch to the user-based billing model. However, both billing models cannot be used for the same app.

## How user-based billing works

User-based billing is exclusively for Forge apps, which includes Forge apps with Connect module.
Instead of paying for the entire user base of the parent Atlassian app, user-based billing allows
customers to buy Marketplace apps for a more targeted subset of users.

Marketplace Partners who transition an existing app to the user-based billing model can adjust their
pricing accordingly. While this change is optional, we recommend that Marketplace Partners choose
the billing model that best aligns with their overall business strategy.

If a partner transitions their app to the user-based billing model, all existing customers on the previous
billing model will be transitioned to the new billing model.

## Benefits of user-based billing

Marketplace Partners should consider adopting user-based billing for several strategic advantages.
This model aligns with Atlassian's objective of reaching both technical and non-technical teams,
as well as larger enterprises. Here’s why:

* **Broader market reach**: With user-based pricing, partners can target a wider audience,
  including non-technical teams, thus tapping into new market segments and increasing potential
  user adoption.
* **Reduces customer friction & facilitates growth**: The user-based billing model can help
  alleviate the friction associated with both user and app expansion. Organizations can add users or
  adopt new apps in a flexible manner, making it easier to integrate Atlassian apps and other apps into
  their workflow. This allows apps to grow organically within an organization as more teams find
  value in them, leading to increased adoption rates.
* **Flexible pricing models**: By charging based on the number of users, partners can offer more
  tailored pricing strategies that align with customer needs, enhancing the value proposition for
  potential customers.
* **Facilitates growth**: This feature supports incremental and broader app adoption within
  organizations over time. Additionally, it enables customers to procure more apps as they
  pay per user, justifying the need and cost when utilized by business-critical teams.
