# Endpoint

If `true` and the remote endpoint is invoked within a user's login session, Forge includes an `appUserToken` in the Forge Invocation Token it sends to the remote app.  This token can be used by the remote app when invoking an Atlassian app API, to invoke the API with the permissions of the user in whose login session the app is running.  Specifically, the API will have only as much access to the site's data as that user does. For example, if the user does not have permission to see pages in a particular space or issues in a particular project, the API won't provide them access to that space or page, either.  Forge modules that run outside of a user's login session, such as an app lifecycle event or product event are not associated with a user and cannot send an `appUserToken` to the remote app.  If an endpoint opts to enable remote user token access, the `read:app-user-token` scope must also be specified in the [Permissions](/platform/forge/manifest-reference/permissions) section of the manifest. |
