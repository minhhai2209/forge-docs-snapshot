# Dashboard modules

Forge's EAP offers experimental features to selected users for testing and feedback purposes.
These features are unsupported and not recommended for use in production environments. They
are also subject to change without notice.
For more details, see [Forge EAP, Preview, and GA](/platform/forge/whats-coming/#eap).

To participate, you can [sign up for the EAP here](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/eap-preview-ga/#early-access-program-eap).

**Note:** You must also opt-in to the open beta of Dashboards in Atlassian Home. See the [guide on how to opt-in](https://community.atlassian.com/forums/Atlassian-Home-articles/Home-Dashboards-available-in-open-beta/ba-p/3009544).
