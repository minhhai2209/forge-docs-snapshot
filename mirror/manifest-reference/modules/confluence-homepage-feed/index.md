# Confluence homepage feed

The `confluence:homepageFeed` module displays content in the right panel of the Confluence Home page.
Each module represents a separate section in the panel, and the `title` of each module is used as a section title. When a user clicks an app title, the corresponding section is expanded, and the Forge app is rendered as content.

On apps that use Custom UI, module content is displayed inside a [special Forge iframe](/platform/forge/custom-ui/iframe/) which has the [sandbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#sandbox) attribute configured. This means that HTML links (for example, `<a href="https://domain.tld/path">...</a>`) in this iframe won't be clickable. To make them clickable, use the [router.navigate](/platform/forge/custom-ui-bridge/router/#navigate) API from the `@forge/bridge` package.

When adding this to your app, use it as a top-level component.
