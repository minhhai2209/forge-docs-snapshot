The icon displayed next to the `title`.   For Custom UI and UI Kit apps, the `icon` property accepts a relative path from a declared resource. Alternatively, you can also use an absolute URL to a self-hosted icon. See [Icons](/platform/forge/custom-ui/#icons) for more information.  If no icon is provided, or if there's an issue preventing the icon from loading, a generic app icon will be displayed. |
