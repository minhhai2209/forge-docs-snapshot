# Function

The maximum timeout, specified in seconds. This applies only to the [scheduled triggers module](/platform/forge/manifest-reference/modules/scheduled-trigger/) and the [consumer](/platform/forge/manifest-reference/modules/consumer/) of an asynchronous event. If this parameter is set for a function used by multiple modules, the function timeout will be the lowest timeout value among all modules.  This parameter does not affect functions that are not used as asynchronous event consumers or scheduled triggers.  Valid range: 1 and 900 seconds  **Example**: If you have a function used by both a scheduled trigger (timeoutSeconds: 300 seconds) and an async event consumer (timeoutSeconds: 120 seconds), the function will timeout after 120 seconds, because that’s the lowest value. |
