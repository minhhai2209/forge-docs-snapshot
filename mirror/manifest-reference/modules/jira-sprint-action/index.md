|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | `string` | Yes | A key for the module, which other modules can refer to. Must be unique within the manifest.   *Regex:* `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$` |
| `resource` | `string` | Yes | A reference to the static `resources` entry that your context menu app wants to display. See [resources](/platform/forge/manifest-reference/resources) for more details. |
| `render` | `'native'` | Yes for [UI Kit](/platform/forge/ui-kit/components/) | Indicates the module uses [UI Kit](/platform/forge/ui-kit/components/). |
| `resolver` | `{ function: string }` or `{ endpoint: string }` | Yes | Set the `function` property if you are using a hosted `function` module for your resolver.  Set the `endpoint` property if you are using [Forge Remote](/platform/forge/forge-remote-overview) to integrate with a remote back end. |
| `viewportSize` | `'small'`, `'medium'`, `'large'`, `'xlarge'` or `'max'` |  | The [display size](/platform/forge/manifest-reference/resources) of `resource`. Can only be set if the module is using the `resource` property. Remove this property to enable automatic resizing of the module. |
| `title` | `string` or `i18n object` | Yes | The title of the sprint action, which is displayed as a menu item.  The `i18n object` allows for translation. See [i18n object](#i18n-object). |
| `tooltip` | `string` or `i18n object` |  | The tooltip of the sprint action menu item, which is displayed on hover.  The `i18n object` allows for translation. See [i18n object](#i18n-object). |
| `icon` | `string` |  | The icon displayed next to the `title`.   For Custom UI and UI Kit apps, the `icon` property accepts a relative path from a declared resource. Alternatively, you can also use an absolute URL to a self-hosted icon. See [Icons](/platform/forge/custom-ui/#icons) for more information.  If no icon is provided, or if there's an issue preventing the icon from loading, a generic app icon will be displayed. |
| `displayConditions` | `object` |  | The object that defines whether or not a module is displayed in the UI of the app. See [display conditions](/platform/forge/manifest-reference/display-conditions). |
| `actionType` | `'modal'` or `'dynamic'` |  | Specifies how an action is executed by the app, providing options for modal or dynamic implementations. Defaults to `'modal'`. See [action type](/platform/forge/manifest-reference/action-type/). |
| `actions` | `Action` |  | Defines nested actions supported by this module, which are accessed by hovering on the app item in the more actions menu. |
| `actions.key` | `string` | Yes, if using `actions` | A key for the action nested in this module, which allows the app resources to load different setups or code paths based on the action triggered. Must be unique to the module.  *Regex:* `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`  To determine the key of the action that was triggered, use the `action` property in the `extension` property of the [context](/platform/forge/apis-reference/ui-api-bridge/view/#getcontext) object.  For example: `(await view.getContext()).extension.action;` |
| `actions.title` | `string` or `i18n object` | Yes, if using `actions` | The title of the action, which is displayed as a nested menu item.  The `i18n object` allows for translation and is available to participants of the [Internationalization for Forge EAP](/platform/forge/internationalization). See [i18n object](#i18n-object). |
| `actions.tooltip` | `string` or `i18n object` |  | The tooltip of the action menu item, which is displayed on hover.  The `i18n object` allows for translation and is available to participants of the [Internationalization for Forge EAP](/platform/forge/internationalization). See [i18n object](#i18n-object). |
| `actions.viewportSize` | `'small'`, `'medium'`, `'large'`, `'xlarge'` or `'max'` |  | The [display size](/platform/forge/manifest-reference/resources) of `resource`. Can only be set if the module is using the `resource` property. Remove this property to enable automatic resizing of the module. |
| `actions.actionType` | `'modal'` or `'dynamic'` |  | Specifies how an action is executed within the app, providing options for modal or dynamic implementations. Defaults to `'modal'`. See [action type](/platform/forge/manifest-reference/action-type/). |
