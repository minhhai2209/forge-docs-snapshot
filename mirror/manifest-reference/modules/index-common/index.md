# Forge modules

Forge Dynamic Modules is now available as part of Forge’s Early Access Program (EAP).
To start testing this, sign up [here](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3595).

EAP features and APIs are unsupported, and subject to change without notice. Apps that use dynamic modules should not be deployed to `production` environments.

All dynamic modules created during EAP will not be carried over to Preview. For more details, see [Forge EAP, Preview, and GA](/platform/forge/whats-coming/#eap).
