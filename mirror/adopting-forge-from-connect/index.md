# Incrementally adopting Forge from Connect

Connect apps for **Confluence Cloud** and **Jira Cloud**, including **Jira Service Management**, can now incrementally adopt powerful Forge capabilities, all while keeping their existing features, installations and reviews.

## Why should I adopt Forge?

In minutes, you get access to:

These are available without needing to change anything about your existing Connect code.

## Do I need to re-write my app?

No. You can add Forge features while keeping some or all of your Connect modules.

The Forge parts of your app can communicate with your existing Connect server using [Forge remote](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/forge-remote-overview/), which is seamlessly supported by [official Connect frameworks](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/connect-frameworks-and-tools/#atlassian-frameworks).

## What will happen to my app's existing installations and marketplace listing?

Your app will keep its existing listing with its reviews and installations. See [Listing your Forge successor app on Marketplace](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/adopting-forge-from-connect/listing-your-app-on-marketplace/#step-2--list-your-app-as-a-forge-app) for more details.

## Can I try this without affecting my current Connect app?

Yes. Adopting, extending and testing your app with Forge is a safe process and will not affect your current Connect app or customers.

Existing and new installations of your app will only see the Forge version when it is [added and approved as a new version to your marketplace listing](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/adopting-forge-from-connect/listing-your-app-on-marketplace/#step-2--list-your-app-as-a-forge-app).

## Limitations and caveats

Right now, [some incompatibilities may](/platform/adopting-forge-from-connect/limitations-and-differences) stop your app from adopting Forge.

Note, that incremental adoption of Forge is only available for Confluence and Jira Connect apps that are already listed on Marketplace.
Unfortunately, this adoption pathway is not available for Bitbucket Connect apps.
