# Forge Containers glossary

| Container | A portable, self-contained unit of software. This unit contains all of the dependencies and configurations necessary to launch an isolated process used for providing capabilities for a containerised service. Containers are packaged in images, from which they can also be deployed.   In Forge, containers are defined in the manifest through the `container` property.    **NOTE**: During EAP, you can only define one service with one container, per app. Refer to the [Forge Containers roadmap](/platform/forge/containers-reference/roadmap/) for a full list of EAP-specific limitations. |
| Container instance | The resulting process that runs when you deploy a container. A service instance is made up of one or more container instances. |
| Containerised service | A logical grouping of one or more containers that provide a specific capability. In Forge, a containerised service is defined in the manifest through the top-level `service` property; each `service` contains one or more `container` definitions.   Containerised services handle inbound and outbound requests via REST API.    **NOTE**: During EAP, you can only define one service with one container, per app. Refer to the [Forge Containers roadmap](/platform/forge/containers-reference/roadmap/) for a full list of EAP-specific limitations. |
| [Forge Containers](/platform/forge/containers-reference/) | A set of tools and capabilities provided by Forge to manage containerised services for apps. |
| Image | A read-only, immutable, and executable package containing all the code required to deploy a container. An image contains all of the code’s dependencies, including its runtime, tools, libraries, and settings. |
| Image tag | Image versions are identified by tag; in Forge, these tags are immutable. Image tags like `latest` won't work; we recommend using environment variables on your tagging scheme. |
| Registry | A database of container images and their different versions. In Forge, each container instance is launched from images stored on the Forge Containers registry. The Forge Containers registry is `forge-ecr.services.atlassian.com`. |
| Repository | A dedicated space within the Forge Containers registry for storing different versions of a container’s image. Each container will have its own repository, and Forge apps can deploy specific image versions (identified by tag).Each container repository name follows this structure:`forge-ecr.services.atlassian.com/forge/${APP_ID}/${CONTAINER_KEY}` |
| Service instance | The resulting hosted service that runs when you deploy a containerised service. A service instance is made up of one or more running container instances.   **NOTE**: During EAP, you can only define one service with one container, per app. Refer to the [Forge Containers roadmap](/platform/forge/containers-reference/roadmap/) for a full list of EAP-specific limitations. |
