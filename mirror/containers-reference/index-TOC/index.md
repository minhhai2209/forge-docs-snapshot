Forge Containers are a [set of tools and capabilities](/platform/forge/containers-reference/) for managing containerised services for Forge apps. You can use Forge Containers to package a service’s code and dependencies, opening up a wider range of programming languages and frameworks.

With Forge Containers, you can run services from container images directly on Forge infrastructure. You can update, launch, scale, and otherwise manage the lifecycle of these services using Forge Container tools. In addition, hosted container services unblock important use cases like long-running compute, which were previously not possible with [Forge functions](/platform/forge/function-reference/).
