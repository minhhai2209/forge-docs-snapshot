# Manage alert rules

In addition to creating alert rules, app admins can also do the following tasks to manage alert rules:

If there’s an open alert for the alert rule that you’re trying to manage, making changes to the
alert rule will close the alert.

## Disable and enable alert rules

You can disable an alert rule to temporarily stop an alert from triggering, for example, to stop
unnecessary alerts during planned maintenance. While disabled, emails regarding the alert will not
be sent to any responders. You can then enable the alert rule to resume its operation again.

To disable or enable an alert rule:

1. Access the [developer console](/console/myapps).
2. Select the app that the alert rule is related to.
3. In the side navigation panel, select **Alerts** and then select **Alert rules**.
4. From the **Alert rules** page, select the more options menu, then select one of the following:

   a. **Disable**, to disable the alert rule. Confirm the action by selecting **Disable** in the
   modal that appears.

   b. **Enable**, to enable the alert rule.

## Edit alert rules

You can edit an alert rule to change its parameters or properties, for example, to change the trigger
condition thresholds or add new responders. We recommend periodically reviewing and adjusting alert
rules based on new insights, performance changes, or team feedback.

To edit an alert rule:

1. Access the [developer console](/console/myapps).
2. Select the app that the alert rule is related to.
3. In the side navigation panel, select **Alerts** and then select **Alert rules**.
4. From the **Alert rules** page, select the more options menu and then select **Edit**.
5. In the window that appears, navigate to the fields corresponding to the details you want to edit
   and make the necessary changes.
6. Once you're done making the changes, select **Next**.
7. Select **Update alert rule** to save your changes.

## Delete alert rules

You can delete alert rules that are no longer needed. Note, deleting an alert rule is permanent and
cannot be undone.

To delete an alert rule:

1. Access the [developer console](/console/myapps).
2. Select the app that the alert rule is related to.
3. In the side navigation panel, select **Alerts** and then select **Alert rules**.
4. From the **Alert rules** page, select the more options menu and then select **Delete**.
5. Confirm the action by selecting **Delete** in the modal that appears.

## View alert rule activity

You may want to review alert rule activity for audit purposes. Alert rule activity logs capture details
including if an alert rule has been edited, disabled, enabled, or deleted. It records the time
the change was made and the user that made the change. Alert rule activity logs are available for 90
days.

To view alert rule activity:

1. Access the [developer console](/console/myapps).
2. Select the app that the alert rule is related to.
3. In the side navigation panel, select **Alerts** and then select **Alert rules**.
4. From the **Alert rules** page, select the **Activity** tab.
