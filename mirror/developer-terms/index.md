# Forge Terms

These Forge Terms apply if you use the Atlassian Platform to develop
Forge Apps under the [Atlassian Developer Terms](/platform/marketplace/atlassian-developer-terms/) (the "**Terms**").
The Terms apply to your use of the Forge Framework, subject to the below.
Each party acknowledges and agrees that (i) these Forge Terms may be
conducted through electronic means, and (ii) click-through acceptance
constitutes a valid signature.

For clarity, these Forge Terms apply to components of your Forge Apps that Atlassian is hosting on your behalf. These Forge Terms do not apply to aspects of your App provided by systems or services that are not offered by Atlassian, such as services connected using [Forge Remotes](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/remote/). If your App has [adopted Forge from Connect](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/adopting-forge-from-connect/how-to-adopt/), these Forge Terms do not apply to the portions of your App built using the Connect framework.

Capitalized terms used but not defined in these Forge Terms have the
meanings set out in the Terms.

1. **Submission**. To use Forge Apps with the Atlassian Platform, you
   must submit the Apps to Atlassian in accordance with the Developer
   Guidelines and our instructions. Without limiting your other
   obligations, you will not include any code licensed under any
   version of the GPL, Affero or other "copyleft" license in any Forge
   Apps.
2. **Collaboration on Forge Apps**. Through the Atlassian Platform, you may
   be able to invite other users as contributors to your Forge Apps ("**Contributors**").
   You acknowledge that Contributors will have the ability to take actions that
   affect your Forge Apps without your direct approval, which may include adding
   or removing other Contributors and deploying your Forge Apps. You are responsible
   for whom you allow to become Contributors and any actions they take, including
   as described above. In event of a dispute between multiple contributors to a
   Forge App, Atlassian acknowledges that the owner of the Forge App will
   have authority to resolve the dispute. If Atlassian assistance is
   required to resolve such a dispute, Atlassian will follow any relevant
   instructions provided by the owner of the Forge App.
3. **Usage Limits**. Forge Apps may be subject to usage limits (e.g.,
   compute time) as designated by Atlassian in the Developer Guidelines at
   [https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/platform-quotas-and-limits/](/platform/forge/platform-quotas-and-limits/).
4. **Atlassian's Use of Forge Apps**. In addition to its other rights,
   you grant Atlassian the right to access, host, use, copy,
   distribute, transmit, perform and display your Forge Apps as
   necessary to enable their operation with Atlassian Products and to
   address support, security and performance issues.
5. **End User Data**. Though Atlassian hosts Forge Apps on your behalf,
   you must comply with Section 9 (End User Data & Security) of the Terms
   for any End User Data you or your Forge Apps process. Atlassian may access
   such End User Data in connection with exercising its rights in Section 4
   of these Forge Terms and otherwise in accordance with its
   [Privacy Policy](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy).
   You must not submit, process, or otherwise use any Sensitive Personal
   Information with the Atlassian Platform unless its processing is expressly
   supported as a feature in the Developer Guidelines. Atlassian's data
   processing related to the hosting of Forge Apps is governed by the terms of the
   [Forge Data Processing Addendum](https://dac-static.atlassian.com/platform/forge/resources/Forge-Data-Processing-Addendum.pdf?_v=1.5800.1617)
   ("**DPA**").
6. **Data Residency**. If you elect to use Forge hosted storage in your Forge
   App and one of your end users has enabled data residency for their Forge Apps, you
   understand and acknowledge that you are instructing Atlassian to (a) pin any End User Data
   your Forge App stores using Forge hosted storage ("**Hosted Data**") in the same location
   where the end user has pinned their in-scope product data in the applicable Atlassian
   Product ("**Product Data**"), and (b) migrate any Hosted Data to a new location when
   the end user migrates its Product Data to that location. You acknowledge and agree that
   Hosted Data may be stored in any data residency location currently supported for in-scope Atlassian Product data, as listed here: [Understand data residency | Atlassian Support](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/understand-data-residency/).
7. **Rovo APIs**. The Forge Framework includes modules that enable you to enhance your Forge Apps with artificial intelligence agents (“**Agents**”) and other functionality powered by Atlassian Rovo (“**Rovo APIs**”). When you use Rovo APIs, you must comply with the [Atlassian Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy), including its specific requirements for using artificial intelligence offerings and features. For the protection of our customers, Atlassian performs safety screening on any Agents that you submit at our sole discretion. If we identify any issues with your Agent, we may take protective actions, such as preventing the Agent from being deployed or suspending your use of Rovo APIs. Where possible we will notify you of the nature of the issue, and you must use reasonable commercial efforts to correct the issue before deploying your Agent again.
8. **Removal of Forge Apps**. You may remove, or request to have your Forge Apps removed
   from the Atlassian Platform, by following and complying with the requirements
   [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/knowledge-base/retiring-your-app/).
   In addition to any other suspension or removal rights granted in the Terms,
   Atlassian may remove or suspend any Forge Apps from the Atlassian Platform (a)
   upon your written request, (b) that have been inactive for an extended period of time,
   or (c) if Atlassian determines, in its sole discretion, that you, or the use of your
   Forge Apps, have violated these Forge Terms, the Terms, or any Laws.
