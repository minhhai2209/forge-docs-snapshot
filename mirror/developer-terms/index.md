# Forge Terms

These Forge Terms apply if you use the Atlassian Platform to develop
Forge Apps under the [Atlassian Developer Terms](/platform/marketplace/atlassian-developer-terms/) (the "**Terms**").
The Terms apply to your use of the Forge Platform, subject to the below.
Each party acknowledges and agrees that (i) these Forge Terms may be
conducted through electronic means, and (ii) click-through acceptance
constitutes a valid signature.

For clarity, these Forge Terms apply to components of your Forge Apps that Atlassian is hosting on your behalf. These Forge Terms do not apply to aspects of your Marketplace App provided by systems or services that are not offered by Atlassian, such as services connected using [Forge Remotes](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/remote/). If your Forge App has [adopted Forge from Connect](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/adopting-forge-from-connect/how-to-adopt/), these Forge Terms do not apply to the portions of your Forge App built using the Connect framework.

Capitalized terms used but not defined in these Forge Terms have the
meanings set out in the Terms.

1. **Submission**. To use Forge Apps with the Atlassian Platform, you
   must submit the Forge Apps to Atlassian in accordance with the Developer
   Guidelines and our instructions. Without limiting your other
   obligations, you will not include any code licensed under any
   version of the GPL, Affero or other "copyleft" license in any Forge
   Apps.
2. **Collaboration on Forge Apps**. Through the Atlassian Platform, you may
   be able to invite other users as contributors to your Forge Apps ("**Contributors**").
   You acknowledge that Contributors will have the ability to take actions that
   affect your Forge Apps without your direct approval, which may include adding
   or removing other Contributors and deploying your Forge Apps. You are responsible
   for whom you allow to become Contributors and any actions they take, including
   as described above. In event of a dispute between multiple contributors to a
   Forge App, Atlassian acknowledges that the owner of the Forge App will
   have authority to resolve the dispute. If Atlassian assistance is
   required to resolve such a dispute, Atlassian will follow any relevant
   instructions provided by the owner of the Forge App.
3. **Platform Quotas and Limits**. Forge Apps may be subject to usage limits (e.g.,
   compute time) as designated by Atlassian in the Developer Guidelines at
   [https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/platform-quotas-and-limits/](/platform/forge/platform-quotas-and-limits/).
4. **Atlassian's Use of Forge Apps**. In addition to its other rights,
   you grant Atlassian the right to access, host, use, copy,
   distribute, transmit, perform and display your Forge Apps as
   necessary to enable their operation with Atlassian Apps and to
   address support, security and performance issues.
5. **End User Data**. Though Atlassian hosts Forge Apps on your behalf,
   you must comply with Section 9 (End User Data & Security) of the Terms
   for any End User Data you or your Forge Apps process. Atlassian may access
   such End User Data in connection with exercising its rights in Section 4
   of these Forge Terms and otherwise in accordance with its
   [Privacy Policy](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy).
   You must not submit, process, or otherwise use any Sensitive Personal Information with the Atlassian Platform unless its processing is expressly supported as a feature in the Developer Guidelines.
6. **Data Processing**. Atlassian's data processing related to the hosting of Forge Apps is governed by the terms of the [Forge Data Processing Addendum](https://dac-static.atlassian.com/platform/forge/resources/Forge-Data-Processing-Addendum.pdf) ("**DPA**"). If you elect to use Forge hosted storage in your Forge App, your documented processing instructions to Atlassian also include the following.
   6.1. **Data Lifecycle**. Atlassian will provision, retain, and delete data within Forge hosted storage in accordance with app lifecycle events as further described in the [Data Lifecycle for Forge Hosted Storage](/platform/forge/storage-reference/hosted-storage-data-lifecycle/).
   6.2. **Data Residency**. Unless otherwise specified by Atlassian, if one of your end users has enabled data residency for their Forge Apps, you understand and acknowledge that Atlassian will (a) pin any End User Data your Forge App stores using Forge hosted storage ("**Hosted Data**") in the same location where the end user has pinned their in-scope product data in the required Atlassian App ("**Atlassian App Data**"), and (b) migrate any Hosted Data to a new location when the end user migrates its Atlassian App Data to that location. You acknowledge and agree that Hosted Data may be stored in any data residency location currently supported for in-scope Atlassian App data, as listed here: [Understand data residency | Atlassian Support](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/understand-data-residency/).
7. **AI Features**.

   7.1. **Generally**. The Forge Platform includes modules that enable you to enhance your Forge Apps with artificial intelligence features (“**AI Features**”). When you use AI Features, you must comply with the [Atlassian Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy), including its specific requirements for using artificial intelligence offerings and features.

   7.2. **Rovo Agent API**. The Rovo Agent API allows developers to create custom artificial intelligence agents powered by Atlassian Rovo (“**Agents**”). For the protection of our customers, Atlassian performs safety screening on any Agents that you submit at our sole discretion. If we identify any issues with your Agent, we may take protective actions, such as preventing the Agent from being deployed or suspending your use of the Rovo Agent API. Where possible we will notify you of the nature of the issue, and you must use reasonable commercial efforts to correct the issue before deploying your Agent again.

   7.3. **Forge LLMs**. If you elect to use Forge LLMs in your Forge App, you acknowledge and agree that you are instructing Atlassian to apply our moderation filters and other safeguards to your requests, and to submit any end user queries included in your requests to Forge LLMs for processing on your behalf. If we identify any issues with your use of Forge LLMs, we may suspend your App or your right to use Forge LLMs at any time in our sole discretion.
8. **Teamwork Graph API**. As conditions on your right to use the Teamwork Graph API, you must satisfy all requirements and comply with any use case limitations or other restrictions in the Developer Guidelines.
9. **REST APIs**. You acknowledge and understand that your Forge App must provide substantial end user functionality without use of Forge REST APIs, and that Forge REST APIs cannot be used to implement features that make up “core” functionality of your Forge App or that are otherwise required for use of your Forge App.
10. **Licensing and Multiple App Compatibility**. For clarity, if your Forge App is designed to be compatible with multiple Atlassian Apps, billing will be calculated based on the user count in the required Atlassian App unless otherwise specified by Atlassian.
11. **Service Levels**. Where applicable, the service level commitment for a Forge Platform component is specified in the [Forge Service Level Agreement](/platform/forge/forge-service-level-agreement/).
12. **Removal of Forge Apps**. You may remove, or request to have your Forge Apps removed
    from the Atlassian Platform, by following and complying with the requirements
    [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/knowledge-base/retiring-your-app/).
    In addition to any other suspension or removal rights granted in the Terms,
    Atlassian may remove or suspend any Forge Apps from the Atlassian Platform (a)
    upon your written request, (b) that have been inactive for an extended period of time,
    or (c) if Atlassian determines, in its sole discretion, that you, or the use of your
    Forge Apps, have violated these Forge Terms, the Terms, or any Laws.
