# Forge changelog

#### FAQ

#### What processes will be in place to prevent this in the future?

Going forward, when an license lapses, apps will move through an suspend/delete cycle, providing time for customers to renew a license to maintain use.

#### How do I know if an app is impacted?

You can check your license state as described in our [documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/listing-forge-apps/#checking-the-license-status "https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/listing-forge-apps/#checking-the-license-status"). Legacy “free” installations will show as `license.active: false`.

#### What happens to app data?

When the app data is stored within Atlassian, it can be recovered for 30 days. After this period, the data will be deleted.
