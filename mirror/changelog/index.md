# Forge changelog

We've introduced two new components to UI Kit, now available in Preview: `AtlassianTile` and `AtlassianIcon`. Use these components to display Atlassian object type icons—such as stories, tasks, epics, blogs, and more—with consistent styling that aligns with the Atlassian Design System.

Both components provide fixed color, size, and styling options for Atlassian object types. Any updates to icon or tile styling in the Atlassian Design System are automatically reflected in your app.

For implementation details and examples, see the [Atlassian icon](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/ui-kit/components/atlassian-icon/ "https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/ui-kit/components/atlassian-icon/") and [Atlassian tile](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/ui-kit/components/atlassian-tile/ "https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/ui-kit/components/atlassian-tile/") component documentation.
