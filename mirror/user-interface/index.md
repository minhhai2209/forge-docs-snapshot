# User interface

Design and build a user-friendly interface for your app. Start by exploring extension points to identify which part of the Atlassian app you want to build a Forge app for, and then develop the user interface using pre-built or custom components.

## Build with UI Kit

[UI Kit](/platform/forge/ui-kit/) offers a wide range of pre-built, customizable components for the Forge platform. This lets you build rich app experiences that align with the Atlassian Design System — the visual language used across all Atlassian apps.

## Extend UI with custom options

### Frame

The [Frame component](/platform/forge/ui-kit/components/frame/) enables you to integrate additional features into existing UI Kit applications. It supports external libraries and frameworks, allowing you to expand your app's interface while maintaining compatibility with UI Kit.

It functions as a container for displaying static front-end applications, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring smooth integration with existing UI Kit elements. Use the Frame component to extend your UI Kit app interface or if your app needs a highly customized design, incorporates external libraries, or utilizes front-end frameworks other than React.

### Custom UI

If you are looking for full customization, you can use Custom UI to build interfaces from scratch using any front-end framework.
