# Extend Atlassian apps with a Forge Rovo Agent

## Integrate with your team's data

Imagine an AI Agent that seamlessly connects to your unique datasets, enabling you to leverage critical information from private databases, bespoke solutions, or even legacy systems. This connection allows AI to adapt to your team’s ecosystem, ensuring that your team does not need to adjust to the AI, thereby enhancing efficiency and productivity. You can securely connect your Forge Agent to these data sources, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected while still being accessible for AI processing.

See the [Weather forecast Rovo Agent](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/rovo-weather/src/main/) example app of how this works in practice.
