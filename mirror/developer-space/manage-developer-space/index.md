# Manage Developer Space settings

As a Developer Space admin, you can update your space’s profile, manage billing, copy its unique ID, and delete the space if needed. These settings help keep your workspace organized, branded, and secure.

## Accessing Developer Space settings

1. In the [Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/), select your Developer Space.
2. From the navigation menu, select **Settings**.

**Permissions:**

* Only Admins can make changes in settings.
* Developers and Viewers can view the settings page, but all options are disabled and no actions can be taken.

## Developer Space profile

Personalize your Developer Space to make it easier for your team to identify and manage.

### Edit name and avatar

Avatar uploading and editing is coming soon.

* You can only edit the space name or avatar if the space has not been published on the Atlassian Marketplace.
* If the space has been published, these details can only be updated from the [Marketplace Partner profile](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/).

**To edit (if eligible):**

1. Select the **edit** icon next to the name or avatar.
2. Update the text or upload a new image (PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, max 2MB, recommended 144x144px).
3. Select **Save** to confirm or **Cancel** to discard changes.

If no avatar is uploaded, a default avatar with the first letter of the space name is shown.

## Developer Space ID

Each Developer Space has a unique ID.

* Select the **copy** icon to copy the ID.
* Use this ID when transferring apps into your Developer Space.

## Billing account

The billing section is enabled for each developer space and displays a link to the [Billing Console](https://billing.atlassian.com/) for managing billing details.

## Delete a Developer Space

You can only delete a Developer Space if it has **no assigned apps**.

1. If eligible, the **Delete Developer Space** button will be enabled.
2. Select it to open the confirmation dialog.
3. Review the warning message.
4. Select **Delete** to confirm, or **Cancel** to abort.

Deleting a Developer Space is permanent and can't be undone.

If there are apps assigned, the delete button is disabled. Remove or transfer all apps first.
