# Why build with Forge

Atlassian Cloud apps are built for extensibility and customization. With the launch of Forge, Atlassian now lets developers host apps on the Atlassian platform. Developers no longer need to provision their own hosting or databases. A full hosting and development environment is provided out of the box, along with a set of building blocks that support use cases from the simple to the complex. With a better developer experience, built-in security features, and the power of the Atlassian platform, developers can innovate faster and build powerful additions to Atlassian apps.

## Industry-leading developer experience

Forge goes far beyond REST APIs and SDKs. The platform offers a ready-to-use setup for building Atlassian apps, so developers can quickly and easily extend Atlassian apps.

## Trusted infrastructure

While security can’t be solved with technology alone, Forge provides tools and features that help developers manage security risks and meet their security (and other) obligations.

Apps built on the Forge developer platform can benefit from inheriting controls to meet 30% of SOC 2 requirements. [Read more](/platform/forge/forge-and-soc2/)

## Platform power

Forge is an extensibility solution purpose-built for the Atlassian platform. Developers have access to the data, Atlassian apps, and UI elements that make up the platform, for apps that work in harmony with their surroundings.
